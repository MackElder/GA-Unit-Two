		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>The dig-deep Wordpress site at <a href="http://dinosaurdracula.com/">Dinosaur Dracula</a></p>
			<p><a href="http://badassdigest.com/">Badass Digest's</a> responsive design and headline-style top strip.</p>
<br><br>
			<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
			<p>I'm impressed by the block creation of news items on Badass Digest, a sleek and simple design that draws readers into the big topics. Dinosaur Dracula is cluttered like a pop-culture basement, but you're still drawn to the center main content.</p>
<br><br>
			<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
			<p>Both seem to be built upon Wordpress themes, working on text as the main thrust. However, there's a cleaner, nearly antiseptic, look to Badass, while Dinosaur makes busy look engaging rather than annoying.</p>
